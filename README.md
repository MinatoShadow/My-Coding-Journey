# 🚀 My Coding Journey

## 👋 Hi, I'm Kushagra
 I'm 13 years old and currently learning **C#🎮** 💻✨  

This GitHub documents my journey from beginner to building real projects 🛠️🧠  
I focus on learning the fundamentals properly instead of rushing 🐢💡  
I chose C# because I wanna become a good 2D/mid 3D not AAA stuff game developer and maybe start my own studio someday and also be a backend dev!

## 🎯 Goals 🎯
- Build a strong foundation in C#🎮💻
- Improve problem-solving and logic 🧩🤓  
- Create real-world backend projects 🖥️⚡  
- Explore Game/Backend development step by step 🤖🌌🎮  

---

## 📚 Currently Learning 📚
- C# basics: variables, data types, loops, conditionals, arrays 🔢🌀   
- Writing small programs to practice logic 💡🛠️  
- Git & GitHub 🌐💻  

---

## 🛠️ Projects 🛠️
> All code logic is written by me 🧑‍💻  
> Comments may be assisted by AI 🤖 because I focus more on logic than explanations ✍️  
(projects coming soon!)
